// What is Time Complexity?
// 1. Amount of time taken by an algorithm to run as a function of length of input

// Why to study T&S Complexity?
// 1.Good software engineer always think about the complexity of code written by her 
// 2. Resources are limites
// 3. Measure algorithm to make efficient  program
// 4. Asked by interviewer after every solution you give

// What is space Complexity?
// 1. Amount of space taken by an algorithm to run as a function of input

// Unit to represent Complexity
// 1. Big O: upper bound
// 2. Theta 0: Average case 
// Omega: Lower bound

// Big O Complexities:
// 1. Contant time O(1)
// 2. Linear time O(n)
// 3. Logarithmic time O(logN)
// 4. Quadratic time O(N^2)
// 5. Cubic time O(N^3)

// O(1), O(logN), O(rootN), O(N), O(nlogn), O(n^2), O(N^3),O(2^n), O(N!), O(N^n)
// O(1) -> least complex
// O(N^n) -> most complex

// No. of operation => K = log2N
